# From the ground up

In odrder to model aerial and surface fuels in 3d, we need to place them on
appropriate topography. Topography will affect fire behavior as well as tree
placement using the tree placement algorithm, as it affects the spatial
locations of crowns and thus their overlap.

Topographical variables such as slope, aspect, slope position, and land surface
curvature may be important for predicting the spatial distribution of fuel
loads.

I will assess topography of our plots/sites visually to determine the
best approach for simulating topography for fire simulations and calculate the
above mentioned variables for each plot. Transect slope was measured in the
field, but I can double check these values using the dem.
