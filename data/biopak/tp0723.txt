  Notes:
  Southeast Alaska; 5 study sites:  three sites, M1 (70 yrs.), M2 (110 yrs.),
  M3 (200 yrs.), were established in the Mendenhall Valley, about 16 km north
  of Juneau, Alaska; Pavlof site is near Freshwater Bay on the eastern side of
  Chichagof Island about 16 km northeast of Tenakee, Alaska (stand originated
  following a major windthrow event in about 1888); Vank Island site is on
  small island about 16 km east of Wrangell, Alaska (logged in 1922). All
  stands were naturally regenerated and situated near sea level.
